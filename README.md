# front-end-dev-test

### Matt Sprague 12/27/17

*What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)*

I built this site using the provided webpack development server to compile SCSS and pug templates. I really enjoy using pug primarily because I'm much more productive using it and I like to use the "includes" feature for better organization and clarity of code. I also find it easier to read than standard HTML. I prefer SCSS over standard CSS for similar organizational reasons and also features like variables and nesting styles.

I used the Twitter-Bootstrap (v3.3.7) CSS Framework to make use of their carousel component in the hero section, the media component in the documents section, and to style the form inputs. However, the grid system I used for the layout is custom. I find using Bootstrap's classes for layout to be cumbersome so I made my own containers and columns using CSS's Flexbox Layout.

I also used a little bit of jQuery mainly to toggle some classes for animation.  

*Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose*

Using the webpack-dev-server was great and I had very few issues while using it. However, I ran into some major issues using webpack to deploy a production build. After spending a lot of time debugging, I unfortunately had to settle on a workaround to get the files deployed on Heroku. Nevertheless the time spent debugging gave me a much better understanding of webpack - a technology I don't have much experience with - and I feel much more confident using it now.

*What you enjoyed the most and why*

I really enjoyed the challenge of finding the best solutions to meet the requirements. Having set parameters to follow allowed me to spend more time being creative in the areas where I could be.
